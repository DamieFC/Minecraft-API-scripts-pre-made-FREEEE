## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can only have SO MUCH vulnerability in a video game, so by vulnerability, I mean anything that will make the device ***FREEZE/STOP WORKING*** or the game ***FREEZE/STOP WORKING***. Put the vulnerability in ***ISSUES***. I will get to it probably within a couple days.
## THANKS!
